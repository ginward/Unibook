# Unibook

This is the Unibook Textbook Exchange platform. It consists of a iOS client written in Objective-C and Server written in JavaScript (NodeJS).

The Server uses a non-SQL database - MongoDB and Redis-data store. The config file for the password to DB can be found at Server/config.js

The iOS client is not the strength of this project. I have to confess that I am not an expert in making the User Interface work in all sizes of the iphones.
